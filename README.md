# HC59_Final_Project
Final Project for HC59


In the course of this github repo I will attempt to extend the applications of the QISKIT tutorial on using quantum circuits along with traditional machine learning methods. In this tutorial a quantam-classical hybrid convolutional neural network is used on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 greyscale handwritten digits from 0-9. Traditional convolutional neural networks have been well-applied to this dataset with extremely accurate results. An example MNIST digit is pictured below.
